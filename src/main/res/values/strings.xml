        start using <i>KeePass Share</i> enter the paths to your KeePass
        database and keyfile, if set. You will also need to
        save your database password.
        All information is <b>securely encrypted</b> using two
        secret keys, one stored in the cloud using your <i>Google Drive</i>
        storage and another saved locally. Your password is never accessible
        without having both keys present. A hacker that steals your Google
        Drive key will be unable to access your password that is saved
        on-device, and someone that is able to steal your device data will be
        unable to decrypt your master password without the secret key saved
        in Google Drive.

        you are running. Request access to passwords by choosing
        to <b>Share</b> with <i>KeePass Share</i> from the application you are
        currently running. A notification or dialog will appear to let you
        select usernames and passwords and allow exporting them to the
        clipboard.
