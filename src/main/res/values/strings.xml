        start using <i>KeePass Share</i> enter the paths to your KeePass
        database and keyfile, if set. You will also need to
        save your database password.
        All information is <b>securely encrypted</b> using two
        secret keys, one stored in the cloud using your <i>Google Drive</i>
        storage and another saved locally. Your password is never accessible
        without having both keys present. A hacker that steals your Google
        Drive key will be unable to access your password that is saved
        on-device, and someone that is able to steal your device data will be
        unable to decrypt your master password without the secret key saved
        in Google Drive.

    <string name="connect_instructions">Get started with
        binding <i>KeePass Share</i>
        to <i>Google Drive</i> by pressing the <b>Connect</b> button. This
        will initialize your secret key in the cloud if it has not already
        been setup. You will be prompted to grant access for storing private
        application data.

    <string name="overview"><i>KeePass Share</i> is an easy way to make
        your passwords immediately available no matter which application
        you are running. Request access to passwords by choosing
        to <b>Share</b> with <i>KeePass Share</i> from the application you are
        currently running. A notification or dialog will appear to let you
        select usernames and passwords and allow exporting them to the
